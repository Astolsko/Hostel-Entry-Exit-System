# Hostel-Entry-Exit-System
In the hostels in india most guards use physical records of students that have gone outside which i've noticed many times that the students fake their entry or dont do it at all which can be quite dangerous as many students now stay outside late at night past the entry time. It can be dangerous for the students as they are at a place unknown to authorities.
In this we implement a QR scanner that'll scan the QR on student's ID card to record the students in/out time as a protective measure.
